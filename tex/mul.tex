    \section{Mul Operator}
            The Multiplication Operator is defined as $f(u, v) = uv$. To find the gradient w.r.t 
        u and v, we will use the product rule of derivatives, which is defined as:

        $$\frac{\delta}{\delta{x}}(uv) = v\frac{\delta{u}}{\delta{x}} + u\frac{\delta{v}}{\delta{x}}$$

        To find the gradient w.r.t u, we will set u as our x and treat v as a constant, 
        which gives us the following:

        $$\frac{\delta}{\delta{u}}(uv) = v\frac{\delta{u}}{\delta{u}} + u\frac{\delta{v}}{\delta{u}} = v + u\frac{0}{\delta{u}} = v$$

        To find the gradient w.r.t v, simply do the same, this time setting v as x and treat u as constant.

        $$\frac{\delta}{\delta{v}}(uv) = v\frac{\delta{u}}{\delta{v}} + u\frac{\delta{u}}{\delta{u}} = v\frac{0}{\delta{v}} + u = u$$

        Therefore, we can say that the gradient w.r.t u is v, and the gradient w.r.t v is u.
